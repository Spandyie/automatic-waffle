Genetic Algorithm library based on  Mordern C++

 Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on
 bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.[

# Five phases are considered in a genetic algorithm.

   1)  Initial population
   2)  Fitness function
   3) Selection
   4) Crossover
   5) Mutation

File main.cpp contains GeneticAlgorithm class which consists of cross_over and mutation function, both these fucntion will be repeatedly called on the origin function until the
value is maximized
